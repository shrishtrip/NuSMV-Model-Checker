# NuSMV-Model-Checker
Creating a model and then verifying it using the NuSMV

## NuSMV
NuSMV is a reimplementation and extension of SMV symbolic model checker, the first model checking tool based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). The tool has been designed as an open architecture for model checking. It is aimed at reliable verification of industrially sized designs, for use as a backend for other verification tools and as a research tool for formal verification techniques.

## About
* You need to install the NuSMv to run the .smv files.
* Also the state diagram is as shown in the image. The CTL and LTL have been checked for all the possible initial states.
